# Microprocessor vs Microcontroller

## üß† Microprocessor
- **Composition:** Contains only a **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**.  
- **Function:** Optimized for **general-purpose, demanding tasks** requiring high performance.  
- **Components:** Requires **external components** like RAM, ROM, and I/O to function as a complete system.  
- **Applications:** Used in **desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices**.  
- **Power & Cost:** Consumes **more energy** and is **more expensive**, as it‚Äôs a robust and powerful component.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Microcontroller
- **Composition:** Contains a **CPU, RAM, ROM, and I/O ports** all on a single chip.  
- **Function:** Designed to perform **specific, dedicated tasks** within an embedded system.  
- **Components:** All necessary components are **integrated internally**, requiring fewer external connections.  
- **Applications:** Found in **household appliances, medical devices, automotive systems, and industrial automation**.  
- **Power & Cost:** Uses **very little energy**, is **cost-effective**, and operates at **lower speeds** suitable for its dedicated tasks.
